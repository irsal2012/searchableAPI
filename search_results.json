    "Content":"Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) affects up to 50% of adults with cystic fibrosis and adds significant morbidity and treatment burden. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of automated insulin delivery with the iLet bionic pancreas (BP) in adults with CFRD in a single-center, open-label, random-order, crossover trial.\nResearch design and methods:\nTwenty participants with CFRD were assigned in random order to 14 days each on the BP or their usual care (UC). No restrictions were placed on diet or activity. The primary outcome was the percent time sensor-measured glucose was in target range 70-180 mg\/dL (time in range [TIR]) on days 3-14 of each arm, and key secondary outcomes included mean continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) glucose and the percent time sensor-measured glucose was in hypoglycemic range <54 mg\/dL.\nTIR was significantly higher in the BP arm than the UC arm (75 \u00b1 11% vs. 62 \u00b1 22%, P = 0.001). Mean CGM glucose was lower in the BP arm than in the UC arm (150 \u00b1 19 vs. 171 \u00b1 45 mg\/dL, P = 0.007). There was no significant difference in percent time with sensor-measured glucose <54 mg\/dL (0.27% vs. 0.36%, P = 1.0), although self-reported symptomatic hypoglycemia episodes were higher during the BP arm than the UC arm (0.7 vs. 0.4 median episodes per day, P = 0.01). No episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycemia occurred in either arm.\nAdults with CFRD had improved glucose control without an increase in CGM-measured hypoglycemia with the BP compared with their UC, suggesting that this may be an important therapeutic option for this patient population.\n\u00a9 2023 by the American Diabetes Association.\nConflict of interest statement\nAfter completion of the study, S.J.R., M.A.H., and C.A.B. became employees of Beta Bionics, Inc.

    "Content":"To evaluate the psychosocial impact and user experience for the insulin-only configuration of iLet bionic pancreas (BP) in persons 6-83 years years of age with type 1 diabetes.\nResearch Design and Methods:\nIn this multicenter, randomized controlled, 13-week trial, 275 adults (221 randomly assigned to the BP group and 54 to the standard of care [SC] group) and 165 youth and their caregivers (112 randomly assigned to the BP group and 53 to the SC group) completed psychosocial questionnaires at baseline, mid-study, and the end of the trial.\nIn all age groups, most participants would recommend using the BP, including those with previous experience using automated insulin delivery devices. Similarly, the vast majority of participants reported a high level of perceived benefits and a low number of perceived burdens. Adult participants reported significant decreases in the fear of hypoglycemia and in diabetes-specific emotional distress, as well as improvements in their perceived well-being.\nFindings demonstrate acceptability, reduced burden, and positive psychosocial outcomes for adults.

    "Summary":"**Summary of the Insulin-Only Configuration of the iLet Bionic Pancreas Study**\n\n1. **Key Information about the Topic:**\n   The study evaluates the psychosocial impact and user experience of the insulin-only configuration of the iLet bionic pancreas (BP) in individuals aged 6-83 years with type 1 diabetes. The focus is on understanding how this automated insulin delivery system affects users' lives, particularly regarding their psychological well-being and daily management of diabetes.\n\n2. **Clinical Findings or Research Outcomes:**\n   - The multicenter, randomized controlled trial involved 275 adults and 165 youth, with most participants expressing a willingness to recommend the BP based on their experiences.\n   - Adults reported significant reductions in the fear of hypoglycemia and diabetes-specific emotional distress, alongside improvements in perceived well-being.\n   - Youth participants also indicated high acceptability and reduced burden, although improvements in psychosocial outcomes were less pronounced compared to adults.\n\n3. **Development Status or Regulatory Updates:**\n   The study is part of ongoing research into automated insulin delivery systems, with the iLet bionic pancreas being evaluated for its effectiveness and user satisfaction. The trial is registered under Clinical Trial Registration Number NCT04200313, indicating formal oversight and adherence to regulatory standards for clinical research.\n\n4. **Technical Details about Methods or Mechanisms:**\n   The study employed a multicenter, randomized controlled design over 13 weeks, with participants completing psychosocial questionnaires at baseline, mid-study,",
