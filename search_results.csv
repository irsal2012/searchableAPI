Participants in that clinical trial completed a brief semi-structured interview after the trial's completion, during which they were asked questions related to their perceptions of and experiences with using the iLet AID system. Analysis of 16 interviews revealed five major themes, which highlighted the positive and beneficial impact of the system on psychological and behavioral aspects of diabetes management.

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of automated insulin delivery with the iLet bionic pancreas (BP) in adults with CFRD in a single-center, open-label, random-order, crossover trial.
Research design and methods:
Twenty participants with CFRD were assigned in random order to 14 days each on the BP or their usual care (UC). No restrictions were placed on diet or activity. The primary outcome was the percent time sensor-measured glucose was in target range 70-180 mg/dL (time in range [TIR]) on days 3-14 of each arm, and key secondary outcomes included mean continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) glucose and the percent time sensor-measured glucose was in hypoglycemic range <54 mg/dL.
TIR was significantly higher in the BP arm than the UC arm (75 ± 11% vs. 62 ± 22%, P = 0.001). Mean CGM glucose was lower in the BP arm than in the UC arm (150 ± 19 vs. 171 ± 45 mg/dL, P = 0.007). There was no significant difference in percent time with sensor-measured glucose <54 mg/dL (0.27% vs. 0.36%, P = 1.0), although self-reported symptomatic hypoglycemia episodes were higher during the BP arm than the UC arm (0.7 vs. 0.4 median episodes per day, P = 0.01). No episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycemia occurred in either arm.
Adults with CFRD had improved glucose control without an increase in CGM-measured hypoglycemia with the BP compared with their UC, suggesting that this may be an important therapeutic option for this patient population.

Research Design and Methods:
In this multicenter, randomized controlled, 13-week trial, 275 adults (221 randomly assigned to the BP group and 54 to the standard of care [SC] group) and 165 youth and their caregivers (112 randomly assigned to the BP group and 53 to the SC group) completed psychosocial questionnaires at baseline, mid-study, and the end of the trial.
In all age groups, most participants would recommend using the BP, including those with previous experience using automated insulin delivery devices. Similarly, the vast majority of participants reported a high level of perceived benefits and a low number of perceived burdens. Adult participants reported significant decreases in the fear of hypoglycemia and in diabetes-specific emotional distress, as well as improvements in their perceived well-being.
Findings demonstrate acceptability, reduced burden, and positive psychosocial outcomes for adults. Children and teenagers also report high acceptability and reduced burden, but less clear improvements in psychosocial outcomes. Clinical Trial Registration Number:

1. **Key Information about the Topic:**
   The study evaluates the psychosocial impact and user experience of the insulin-only configuration of the iLet bionic pancreas (BP) in individuals aged 6-83 years with type 1 diabetes. The focus is on understanding how this automated insulin delivery system affects users' lives, particularly regarding their psychological well-being and daily management of diabetes.

2. **Clinical Findings or Research Outcomes:**
   - The multicenter, randomized controlled trial involved 275 adults and 165 youth, with most participants expressing a willingness to recommend the BP based on their experiences.
   - Adults reported significant reductions in the fear of hypoglycemia and diabetes-specific emotional distress, alongside improvements in perceived well-being.
   - Youth participants also indicated high acceptability and reduced burden, although improvements in psychosocial outcomes were less pronounced compared to adults.

3. **Development Status or Regulatory Updates:**
   The study is part of ongoing research into automated insulin delivery systems, with the iLet bionic pancreas being evaluated for its effectiveness and user satisfaction.
